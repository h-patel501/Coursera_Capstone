## Introduction

As the world progresses to a more and more advanced state the number of cars on the road are also increasing. Whether you are looking at first world countries or third world countries the number of vehicles year on year are increasing as households are able to afford more.
With this in mind a very serious topic comes to light, according to an article by the WHO "Road traffic injuries are estimated to be the eighth leading cause of death globally for all age groups and the leading cause of death for children and young people 5â€“29 years of age".1

The purpose of this project is to bring to light the factors that highly affect the chances of getting into a car accident and to encourage safe driving in the volatile conditions to reduce the risk factors.
The data we have will help us better understand the severity of accidents in various conditions as well as the weather conditions that contribute to the accidents.

Government bodies would be very interested in the accurate predictions of the severity of an accident, to help them reduce the response times of medical staff as well as properly allocate the resources where needed to boost awareness of risk factors i.e. increase in signage, road repairs etc



Governments should be highly interested in accurate predictions of the severity of an accident, in order to reduce the time of arrival and thus save a significant amount of people each year. Others interested could be private companies investing in technologies aiming to improve road safeness.

This project consist of several parts divided in two different notebooks.
