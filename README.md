## Introduction

As the world progresses to a more and more advanced state the number of cars on the road are also increasing. Whether you are looking at first world countries or third world countries the number of vehicles year on year are increasing as households are able to afford more.
With this in mind a very serious topic comes to light, according to an article by the WHO "Road traffic injuries are estimated to be the eighth leading cause of death globally for all age groups and the leading cause of death for children and young people 5â€“29 years of age".1

The purpose of this project is to bring to light the factors that highly affect the chances of getting into a car accident and to encourage safe driving in the volatile conditions to reduce the risk factors.
The data we have will help us better understand the severity of accidents in various conditions as well as the weather conditions that contribute to the accidents.
