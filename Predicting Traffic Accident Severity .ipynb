    "As the world progresses to a more and more advanced state the number of cars on the road are also increasing. Whether you are looking at first world countries or third world countries the number of vehicles year on year are increasing as households are able to afford more. With this in mind a very serious topic comes to light, according to an article by the WHO \"Road traffic injuries are estimated to be the eighth leading cause of death globally for all age groups and the leading cause of death for children and young people 5â€“29 years of age. More people now die in road traffic crashes than from HIV/AIDS\".<sup>1</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to bring to light the factors that highly affect the chances of getting into a car accident and to encourage safe driving in the volatile conditions to reduce the risk factors. The data we have will help us better understand the severity of accidents in various conditions as well as the weather conditions that contribute to the accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Government bodies would be very interested in the accurate predictions of the severity of an accident, to help them reduce the response times of medical staff as well as properly allocate the resources where needed to boost awareness of risk factors i.e. increase in signage, road repairs etc"

    "There are two columns which record the date (\"Incident Date\", \"Incident Date & Time\") with these two columns I may try to remove one and seperate the time from the date so that we can group accidents that have happened at certain times of the day as well as identify the biggest risk factors that have caused accidents at those times in particular.\n"
